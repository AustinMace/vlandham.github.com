  <p>This tutorial was written for the popular data visualization site <a href="http://flowingdata.com">Flowing Data</a>. The tutorial is paired with source code and a demonstration site for building an interactive network visualization</p>

  <p>The data used to demonstrate this type of visualization is song similarity data from <a href="http://www.last.fm/api">last.fm</a>. The visualization includes the ability to search for songs, filter based on song popularity, and change the layout of the visualization.</p>

  <div class="thumbnail left">
    <a href="http://vallandingham.me/bubble_cloud/"><img src="/images/vis/bubble_cloud_thumb.png" alt="image for bubble cloud"/></a>
  </div>
  <p>Based on the NYT's <a href="">convention word usage visualizations</a>, this bubble cloud visualization provides an interesting alternative to the traditional word cloud.</p>

  <p>Custom forces provide a unique user experience. Bubbles can be clicked and moved around for more interactivity.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://vallandingham.me/building_a_bubble_cloud.html">Bubble Cloud Tutorial</a> goes over the details of the implementation.</p>

  <p>This simple visualization was made as a demonstration of how the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/02/13/us/politics/2013-budget-proposal-graphic.html">New York Times Budget Chart</a> works.</p>
  <p>Each bubble represents a grant from the Gates Foundation given to an educational system. Fluid animations are used to transition views from a single group to multiple groups based on year.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://vallandingham.me/bubble_charts_in_d3.html">Original Blog Post</a> describes how its done.</p>

  <div class="thumbnail left">
    <a href="http://stowers.org/stowersreport/maps"><img src="/images/vis/collab_thumb.png" alt="image of collaboratino network"/></a>
  </div>
  <p>This interactive network visualization explores the relationships between individuals and groups at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research.</p>
  <p>Each connection represents a research paper collaboration between scientists. Scientists are grouped by what lab they are a member of. The user can move groups and individuals around to expore relationships between labs.</p>
  <p>The network was featured as a special in both online and print forms of the <a href="http://stowers.org/media/stowers-report-spring-2012">Stowers Report - Spring 2012</a>. Source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/vlandham/collab_source">on github</a></p>

  <p>Developed for <a href="http://www.colliers.com/en-US/government">Colliers International</a> for their <a href="http://www.capitolmarkets.com/">Capitol Markets</a> blog, this interactive dashboard allows for the exploration of government leased properties based on important factors.</p>
  <p>Custom sliders allow users to filter over 5,500 GSA properties in the USA. Locations are displayed on an interactive map and metrics for the filtered properties are automatically updated.</p>

  <p>A fun little web-app that allows you to make custom Delaunay-style maps in the tradition of the <a href="http://feltron.com/">Feltron Report</a>.</p>
  <p>Add new points, change the background and annotation colors, modify the annotations, and then save the resulting visualization for later. Uses D3.js and a number of jQuery plugins to make magical things happen.</p>

  <p>How much do the movies we love make? How about the duds we should have missed? This visualization allows the user to explore the relationships between film budget, profits, and user ratings. Search through Hollywood films from 2007 - 2011. Filter based on genre and story type.</p>
  <p>Created for and using data from the <a href="http://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/">Information Is Beautiful Awards Movie Visualization Contest</a>. Works best in Google Chrome</p>

<p>An interesting use of force-directed graphs combined with geographical maps: the force-directed map. Used here to create a visual representation of how segregation in U.S. cities effects communities today.</p>
<p>Areas with sharply segregated boundaries push away from each other, while areas of homogeneity stay largely static</p>
  <p>The <a class="" href="http://vallandingham.me/visualizing_the_racial_divide.html">Original Blog Post</a> describes the visualization in more detail. Uses d3.js and looks best in Google Chrome.</p>

<h2>Old Visualizations Made New Again</h2>

<p>A selection of charts from the turn of the century recreated using <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">d3.js</a>. I wanted to get a chance to practice basic visualization techniques using d3, as well as learn a bit of <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">coffeescript</a> in the process. I am also fascinated with America's past. Thus, recreating old visualizations using modern technologies seemed like a good fit.</p>

<p><a href="http://vallandingham.me/recreating_old_vis_with_new_tech.html">Here is my original blog post on this visualization</a>.</p>

<p>With these recreations, I attempt to stay true to the original design. Because the process of extracting the raw data out of the original graphs is rather labor intensive, not all the data points are displayed in these updated versions. Also, because of the manual process, values might not exactly match the originals. Visualizations look good in Chrome and Firefox 4.</p>

<h2>License Usage Dashboard</h2>

</div>
<p>Managing licenses for shared applications, and knowing when to add more licenses can be tricky. This dashboard satisfies a need of knowing how often the licenses for a particular piece of shared software, Matlab, were being maxed out. Matlab has an interesting license structure in which each package has their own number of licenses - independent of the overall Matlab licenses. So there was a need to track each package's license separately.</p>

<p>This simple dashboard provides an overview of when licenses are being used, when these licenses are being maxed out, and who is using these licenses.</p>
