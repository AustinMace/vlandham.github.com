An attempt at making the best no-knead bread with the least amount of work.

h2. Attempt #1: Baseline

Starting with a simplified version of a recipe already deemed so easy, a 5 year-old could do it.

h3. Ingredients

table(ingredients).
|=. *Ingredient* |=. *Brand* |=. *Amount* |
|=. white flour |=. King Arthur: unbleached white bread flour |=. 3 cups |
|=. yeast |=. All purpose yeast from local organic grocery store |=. 1/4 teaspoon |
|=. salt |=. Morton's sea salt |=. 1 teaspoon |
|=. water |=. From the tap |=. 1 & 1/2 cup |

h3. Mixing Instructions

* Combine dry ingredients (flour, yeast, salt) in large mixing bowl.
* Add wet ingredient (water) to the bowl.
* Use large wooden spoon to move the ingredients around enough until they are all part of a single mass of dough. Ensure there is no flour outside of this mass.
* Cover bowl with cryan wrap.

h3. Cooking Instructions

* Get out large soup pot.
* Ensure pot will fit in oven with lid on.
* Turn oven to 400 degrees.
* Tear off piece of parchment paper large enough to cover the bottom of the pot. Our piece went up the sides of the pot as well.
* Place parchment paper in the pot.
* Apply a sprinkling of flour to the parchment paper. 
* Cover hands in flour.
* Use hands to pull dough ball away from the sides of the bowl it is in. Method used was to scrape the sides of the bowl with fingers while pulling dough ball away from sides. Also detach dough ball from bottom of bowl.
* Place dough ball in pot. Cover with lid.
* Put pot in oven. Oven was not preheated by the time the pot was inserted.
* Set timer for 30 minutes
* After 30 minutes have elapsed, remove lid from pot and put pot back in oven.
* Set timer for another 30 minutes.
* After 30 minutes, remove pot from oven. Get out cooling rack or cutting board. 
* Pull out bread from pot using the parchment paper to carry it out.
* Let cool for 2 - 6 hours.
* Cut with bread knife. Enjoy alone, or with vinegar and oil.

h3. Uncontrolled Variables

* *Temperature* - Cool spring day in midwest. Inside temperature *69 degrees*. 
* *Humidity* - Inside humidity *54%*. Rained the next day.

I'd say for our first try, this bread turned out pretty darn good. Mostly a testament to the true ease of these recipes.

h4. Strengths

* Looks good on the outside.
* Aesthetic and authentic air pockets on the inside.
* Good texture on the inside.
* Pleasant taste.

h4. Weaknesses

* Crust was a bit chewy.
* While flavor was good, there wasn't a lot of it.
* Excess amount of flour on the bottom of the loaf.
