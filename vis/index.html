<h2>Old Visualizations Made New Again</h2>
<p>A selection of charts from the turn of the century recreated using <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">d3.js</a>. I wanted to get a chance to practice basic visualization techniques using d3, as well as learn a bit of <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">coffeescript</a> in the process. I am also fascinated with America's past. Thus, recreating old visualizations using modern technologies seemed like a good fit.</p>

<p><a href="http://vallandingham.me/recreating_old_vis_with_new_tech.html">Here is my original blog post on this visualization</a>.</p>

<p>With these recreations, I attempt to stay true to the original design. Because the process of extracting the raw data out of the original graphs is rather labor intensive, not all the data points are displayed in these updated versions. Also, because of the manual process, values might not exactly match the originals. Visualizations look good in Chrome and Firefox 4.</p>

  <h2>Visualizing The Racial Divide</h2>
  <p>An interesting use of force-directed graphs combined with geographical maps: the force-directed map. Used here to create a visual representation of how segregation in U.S. cities effects communities today.</p>
  <p>The <a class="" href="http://vallandingham.me/visualizing_the_racial_divide.html">Original Blog Post</a> describes the visualization in more detail. Uses d3.js and looks best in Google Chrome.</p>
