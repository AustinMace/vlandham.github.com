<h2>Old Graphs Made New Again</h2>
<p>A selection of charts from the turn of the century recreated using <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">d3.js</a>. I wanted to get a chance to practice basic visualization techniques using d3, as well as learn a bit of <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">coffeescript</a> in the process. I am also fascinated with America's past. Thus, recreating old visualizations using modern technologies seemed like a good fit.</p>

<p>With these recreations, I attempt to stay true to the original design. Because the process of extracting the raw data out of the original graphs is rather labor intensive, not all the data points are displayed in these updated versions. Also, because of the manual process, values might not exactly match the originals.</p>
